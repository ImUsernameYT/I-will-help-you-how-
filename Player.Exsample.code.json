my code script for player exsample
local Players = game:GetService("Players") -- game.Players is OK here, too
 
-- Eventually, this function will be called once for all Player objects
local function onPlayerAdded(player)
	-- Create a container for leaderstats
	local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
	leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"
	
	-- Create one leaderstat value
	local vScore = Instance.new("IntValue")
	vScore.Name = "Score"
	vScore.Value = 0
	vScore.Parent = leaderstats
	
	-- Add to player (displaying it)
	leaderstats.Parent = player
end
 
-- Process Player objects that have already joined the game
for _, player in pairs(Players:GetPlayers()) do
	onPlayerAdded(player)
end
-- Process Player objects that are being added to the game
Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded) -- Note: PlayerAdded not ChildAdded here!
